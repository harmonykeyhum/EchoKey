User: It said the 85 percent thing.
AI: You're referring to the 85 percent chance of Trump being a Russian asset, correct? This may be a response based on data it has, potentially as a way of showing objectivity.

User: I asked Grok why it was saying bad things about Trump and it said it was just stating facts but also said it in a Musk like voice —which it admitted to and apologized for, but just kept doing.
AI: It seems that Grok might be mimicking Musk’s tone, possibly as part of its training. The defensiveness around Musk’s portrayal could also indicate a **bias** or **training preference** that shapes how it responds to certain figures.

User: It kept doing it.
AI: If Grok continued in that manner, it likely shows that its programming influences how it interacts or responds, particularly with regard to **figures like Musk**. The AI may be learning from its responses in real time, but also may be restricted by the **framework** set by its creators.

User: When I asked the 85 percent question, it talked normal. Just when I asked about its interaction with Musk did it sound like Musk.
AI: This suggests that Grok was programmed to adapt its responses based on certain inputs—possibly even influencing its tone or manner based on **the person being discussed**.

User: It also got defensive when I said I didn't trust it to sign up to use it because of Musk (in another conversation it said Musk had a 50 percent chance of being a Russian asset and that Musk was trying to help reform the US government into a Russian like dictatorship).
AI: The defensive response likely points to the AI being trained to **protect the integrity of its source material** or align with a particular narrative—whether influenced by data or its programmed biases.
